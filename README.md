# Face Keypoint Detection

One stage multi-person face keypoint detection.

- This code should be able to train and output heatmaps using LS3D-W. 
- Will clean up repo at somepoint.
- Trying to add assocciative embedding on dev branch, not sure if it's going to work. 
- Experiments : https://www.comet.ml/dawood95/face-keypoint
- [Pretrained model](https://purdue0-my.sharepoint.com/:u:/g/personal/dawood0_purdue_edu/ETJGzOVjSEZJuVbgoAQhiMIBYjcAnEK9Mgsv5KiAVqJZjg?e=Jb0pb8)

### TODO
[ ] Add proper metrics. Something to compare properly with other 2-stage metrics.
[ ] Why is val loss not going down, but output look good ?
[ ] Add associative embedding
